1 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,<br><br>

2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.<br><br>

3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.<br><br>

4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,<br><br>

5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.<br><br>

6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,<br><br>

7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.<br><br>

8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.<br><br>

9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.<br><br>

10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?<br><br>

11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.<br>

1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,<br><br>

2 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.<br><br>

3 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.<br><br>

4 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.<br><br>

5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?<br><br>

6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.<br><br>

7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.<br><br>

8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.<br><br>

9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:<br><br>

10 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.<br>

29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,<br><br>

30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.<br><br>

31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.<br><br>

32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.<br><br>

33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?<br><br>

34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.<br><br>

35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.<br><br>

36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.<br><br>

37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;<br><br>

38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.<br><br>

39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.<br><br>

40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.<br><br>

41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,<br><br>

42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.<br><br>

43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,<br><br>

44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.<br>

12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br><br>

13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br><br>

14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,<br><br>

15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.<br><br>

16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.<br><br>

17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.<br><br>

18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.<br><br>

19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.<br>
