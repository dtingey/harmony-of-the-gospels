32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.<br><br>

33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,<br><br>

34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.<br><br>

35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.<br><br>

36 And sitting down they watched him there;<br><br>

37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>

38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.<br>

21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.<br><br>

22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.<br><br>

23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.<br><br>

24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<br><br>

25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<br><br>

26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>

27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.<br><br>

28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.<br>
      </div>
      <div class="cell">
26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.<br><br>

27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.<br><br>

28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<br><br>

29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.<br><br>

30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.<br><br>

31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?<br><br>

32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.<br><br>

33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.<br>

17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:<br><br>

18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.<br><br>

19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>

20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.<br><br>

21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.<br><br>

22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.<br><br>

23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<br><br>

24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.<br>
