15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.<br><br>

16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.<br><br>

17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?<br><br>

18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.<br><br>

19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.<br><br>

20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.<br><br>

21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.<br><br>

22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.<br><br>

23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.<br><br>

24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.<br><br>

25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.<br><br>

26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.<br>

6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.<br><br>

7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.<br><br>

8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.<br><br>

9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?<br><br>

10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.<br><br>

11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.<br><br>

12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?<br><br>

13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.<br><br>

14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.<br><br>

15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.<br>

      <div class="cell">
13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<br><br>

14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:<br><br>

15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.<br><br>

16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.<br><br>

17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)<br><br>

18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:<br><br>

19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)<br><br>

20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.<br><br>

21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.<br><br>

22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.<br><br>

23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.<br><br>

24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.<br><br>

25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.<br>

18:29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?<br><br>

19:16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.<br>
