57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<br><br>

58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<br><br>

69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.<br><br>

70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<br><br>

71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.<br><br>

72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.<br><br>

73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.<br><br>

74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<br><br>

75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<br>

53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.<br><br>

54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.<br><br>

66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:<br><br>

67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.<br><br>

68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.<br><br>

69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.<br><br>

70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.<br><br>

71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.<br><br>

72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.<br>

54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.<br><br>

55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.<br><br>

56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.<br><br>

57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.<br><br>

58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.<br><br>

59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.<br><br>

60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.<br><br>

61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br><br>

62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.<br><br>

63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.<br><br>

64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?<br><br>

65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.<br>

12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,<br><br>

13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.<br><br>

14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.<br><br>

15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.<br><br>

16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.<br><br>

17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.<br><br>

18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.<br><br>

19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.<br><br>

20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.<br><br>

21 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.<br><br>

22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?<br><br>

23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?<br><br>

24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.<br><br>

25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.<br><br>

26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?<br><br>

27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.<br>
