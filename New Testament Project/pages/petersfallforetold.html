31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<br><br>

32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.<br><br>

33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.<br><br>

34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br><br>

35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<br>

27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.<br><br>

28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.<br><br>

29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.<br><br>

30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br><br>

31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.<br>

31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:<br><br>

32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.<br><br>

33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.<br><br>

34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.<br><br>

35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.<br><br>

36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.<br><br>

37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.<br><br>

38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.<br><br>

39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.<br>

36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.<br><br>

37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.<br><br>

38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.<br>
