36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.<br><br>

37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<br><br>

38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.<br><br>

39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.<br><br>

40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?<br><br>

41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br><br>

42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.<br><br>

43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.<br><br>

44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.<br><br>

45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br><br>

46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.<br>

32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.<br><br>

33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;<br><br>

34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.<br><br>

35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.<br><br>

36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.<br><br>

37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?<br><br>

38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.<br><br>

39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.<br><br>

40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.<br><br>

41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br><br>

42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.<br>

40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.<br><br>

41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,<br><br>

42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.<br><br>

43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.<br><br>

44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.<br><br>

45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,<br><br>

46 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.<br>
