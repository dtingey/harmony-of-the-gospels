13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<br><br>

14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<br><br>

15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<br><br>

16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<br><br>

17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<br><br>

18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br><br>

19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.<br>

27 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?<br><br>

28 And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.<br><br>

29 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.<br>

18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?<br><br>

19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.<br><br>

20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.<br>

66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.<br><br>

67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?<br><br>

68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.<br>
