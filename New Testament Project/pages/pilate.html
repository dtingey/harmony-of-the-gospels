1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:<br><br>

2 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.<br><br>

11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.<br><br>

12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.<br><br>

13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?<br><br>

14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.<br>

1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.<br><br>

2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.<br><br>

3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.<br><br>

4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.<br><br>

5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.<br>

1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.<br><br>

2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.<br><br>

3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.<br><br>

4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.<br><br>

5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.<br><br>

6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.<br>

33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?<br><br>

34 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?<br><br>

35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?<br><br>

36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.<br><br>

37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.<br><br>

38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.<br><br>

39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?<br><br>

40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.<br>
