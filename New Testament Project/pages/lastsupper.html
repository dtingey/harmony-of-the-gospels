17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?<br><br>

18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.<br><br>

19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.<br><br>

20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.<br><br>

21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<br><br>

22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?<br><br>

23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.<br><br>

24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.<br><br>

25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.<br><br>

26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<br><br>

27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<br><br>

28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br><br>

29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br><br>

30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>

12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?<br><br>

13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.<br><br>

14 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?<br><br>

15 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.<br><br>

16 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.<br><br>

17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.<br><br>

18 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.<br><br>

19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?<br><br>

20 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.<br><br>

21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.<br><br>

22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<br><br>

23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.<br><br>

24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.<br><br>

25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.<br><br>

26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>

7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.<br><br>

8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.<br><br>

9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?<br><br>

10 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.<br><br>

11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?<br><br>

12 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.<br><br>

13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.<br><br>

14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.<br><br>

15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:<br><br>

16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<br><br>

17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:<br><br>

18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.<br><br>

19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br><br>

20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.<br><br>

21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.<br><br>

22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!<br><br>

23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.<br>

1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.<br><br>

2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;<br><br>

3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;<br><br>

4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.<br><br>

5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.<br><br>

6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?<br><br>

7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.<br><br>

8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<br><br>

9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<br><br>

10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.<br><br>

11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.<br><br>

12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?<br><br>

13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<br><br>

14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.<br><br>

15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.<br><br>

16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.<br><br>

17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.<br><br>

18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.<br><br>

19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.<br><br>

20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br><br>

21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<br><br>

22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.<br><br>

23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.<br><br>

24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.<br><br>

25 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?<br><br>

26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.<br><br>

27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.<br><br>

28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.<br><br>

29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.<br><br>

30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.<br><br>

31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<br><br>

32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.<br><br>

33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.<br><br>

34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<br><br>

35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.<br>
