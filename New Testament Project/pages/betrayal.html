47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<br><br>

48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.<br><br>

49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.<br><br>

50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.<br><br>

51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.<br><br>

52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.<br><br>

53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<br><br>

54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<br><br>

55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.<br><br>

56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.<br>

43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.<br><br>

44 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.<br><br>

45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.<br><br>

46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.<br><br>

47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.<br><br>

48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?<br><br>

49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.<br><br>

50 And they all forsook him, and fled.<br><br>

51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:<br><br>

52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.<br>

47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.<br><br>

48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?<br><br>

49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?<br><br>

50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.<br><br>

51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.<br><br>

52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?<br><br>

53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.<br>

2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.<br><br>

3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.<br><br>

4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?<br><br>

5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.<br><br>

6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.<br><br>

7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.<br><br>

8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:<br><br>

9 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.<br><br>

10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.<br><br>

11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?<br>
